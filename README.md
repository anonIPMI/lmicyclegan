# Improved CycleGAN for cross-modal DTI andMRI augmentation in brain disease classification

With the improved Cy-cleGAN, we demonstrate cross-modal MRI and DTI augmentation foridentification of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD)patients. We show that these new penalties lead to statistically signif-icant improvements in disease classification such that our methods im-prove AD classification using MRI scans by 6.9% and using DTI scansby 6.8%, respectively, and PD classification using MRI scans and DTIscans by 16.5% and 19.4%, respectively.
